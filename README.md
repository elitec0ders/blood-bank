# PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM

A Public Distribution System designed against all the shortcomings and problems related to the
current pandemic conditions.
We have designed it in such a manner that it won't spread the disease further more, but will help in
terminate it from the roots, it will help all the needy peoples and our aim will be to spread
awareness as much as possible, so as to terminate the spreading, thus helping the frontline warriors
in our own way.

Idea is explained in depth on our [GitRepo](https://github.com/elitec0ders/incubate-ind_PDS#idea) and
[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18iHwsYymjn0AhYJ47T4YuOAbxMJKtnFXHhvLpbjGq3c/edit?usp=sharing).

# IDEA

## Raise funds

- Request Government to give us funds to initialize our project, we will present this same project
  to them, so that they can see our work and dedication after that give us funds accordingly.
- Collect donations from individuals and organisations.
- Request the manufacturing companies to donate goods or give discount on there goods.
- **Sell products and put all the profit in this project.**
    - This will be our main source of funds in the long run.
    - We will try to make personalised masks and sanitizers of different colors and scents so that
      it will attract more consumers and we will be able to help more needy peoples (more about this
      [later on](#sell-to-distribute)).

## Provide Jobs to Needy

We'll try to hire those who are needy and desperate to earn a living for there family.
- **Tailors**: to manufacture masks at large scale.
- **Artists**: to create amazing looking masks and also custom made masks for our customers.
- **Heavy vehicle drivers**: to transport goods from manufacturing centers to our warehouse and
  from our warehouses to our camps.
- **Light vehicle drivers**: to deliver products from our warehouse to customer's door.
- **Technical Engineers**: to maintain our services across all the centers.
- **Medical Students**: to vaccinate everyone once the vaccine is made.
- **Educated Helpers**: to maintain the records of the people receiving our services.
- **Helpers**: to help in our chores.

## Buy and Donate

Customers will buy from us, and will will donate all the profit which we will make, so in this case
all our customers are doing charity by purchasing our products, we will invest all the profit in
food and essentials for the needy.

- We will be making customised masks and sanitizers to attract more and more customers.
- We will also give premium services to those who can afford by making them personalised masks
  according to there request.

Customers will buy them and we will put all our profit in this project towards a **future world made
with equality**.

## Distribution System
<!-- TODO: need more points -->

- We will setup camps near to the places where there are plenty of needy and poor peoples, and also
  in many Government Schools and Colleges in villages and suburban areas.
- These centers will be the **main distribution head** of our system.
- We will also rent many warehouses to store our goods and products, we will try to rent them 
  near to the camps **keeping in mind the feasibility of our project**.
- We will collect all our goods at the warehouse and then transport them as needed to the camps.
- We will also deliver the products to customers doorstep from our warehouse only.
- All the goods will be **packed in airtight packets**, so as to increase th hygiene and also
  reducing the theft.

## Spread Awareness

It is our responsibility to spread awareness as much as we can, among the poor and needy peoples
because they are the one who are worst affected during this pandemic.

#### The things to be made aware of
- How to **wash hands properly**.
- The **importance of mask**.
- Why we should **keep a physical distance** of at least 2 meters.
- Major **symptoms of COVID-19.

#### The methods to spread awareness
- Place an LCD at all the camps and will play informative videos in it at all times, it will be
  be useful for illiterate peoples.
- Large pictorial posters of all the above mentioned things.
- We will also appoint a person to solve queries of all the peoples regarding this pandemic.

## Vaccination

- Up till when the vaccines will come to the market our system will become mature enough to increase
  it's responsibility and then we will be able to start vaccinating peoples at our camps.
- We will create an isolated block for this service.
- We will hire **qualified medical students** to vaccinate peoples.
- From our matured PDS we will be able to supply vaccines to all over the country.

## Ask for volunteering

- As we grow we will start taking helps from volunteers.
- Before assigning them tasks we will take a personal interview of them to get a decent idea of
  there personal nature, so as to eliminate any future hassle.

## Marketing

- We will market ourselves as:
    - an **E-commerce site** for those who can afford daily needs.
    - a **Free Distributing Organisation** for anyone who is needy.
- We will advertise ourselves on various social media platforms.
- We will distribute pamphlets near the places where we setup our camps, so that more and more
  people will be aware of our Organisation and will receive maximum benefit from our services.

# PDS (Public distribution system)

A Public Distribution System designed against all the shortcomings and problems related to the
current pandemic conditions.
We have designed it in such a manner that it won't spread the disease further more, but will help in
terminate it from the roots, it will help all the needy peoples and our aim will be to spread
awareness as much as possible, so as to terminate the spreading, thus helping the frontline warriors
in our own way.

Idea is explained in detail in our [GitRepo](https://github.com/elitec0ders/incubate-ind_PDS#idea) and
[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18iHwsYymjn0AhYJ47T4YuOAbxMJKtnFXHhvLpbjGq3c/edit?usp=sharing).

## IDEA

Our IDEA in order:

### Raise funds:

- Request Government to give us funds to initialize our project, we present this same project to
  them, so that they can see our work and dedication and then give us funds accordingly.
- Collect donations from individuals and organisations.
- Request the manufacturing companies to donate or sell there goods at low price.
- **Sell goods and put all the profit in this project.**
    - This will be our main source of funds.
    - We will try to make personalised masks and sanitizers of different scents so that it will
      attract more and more consumers and we will be able to help more and more needy peoples.
    - More about this [later on](#sell-to-distribute).

### Provide Jobs to needy

We'll try to hire those who are needy and desperate to earn a living for there family.

- Tailors, to manufacture masks at large scale.
- Artists, to create designed masks and also custom masks for customers.
- Heavy vehicle drivers, to transport goods from manufacturing center to our warehouse and
  from warehouse to our camps.
- Light vehicle drivers, to deliver products from our warehouse to customers door.
- Helpers, to help in our chores.

### Sell to Distribute
<!-- TODO: iski heading ka kuch idea do, thoda catchy hona chahiya -->

- Our plan is to collect funds by selling goods and use the collected fund to distribute goods among
  the needy.
- We will be making customised masks and sanitizers to attract more and more customers.

Customers will buy them and we will put all our profit in this project towards a equality minded
future.

### Distribution System

- We will setup camps near to the places where there are plenty of needy peoples.
    - Ex: slum areas, poor urban and rural areas etc.
- We will collect all our goods at the warehouse and then transport them as needed to the camps
<!-- TODO: more points in this section -->

### Ask for volunteers

- As we spread we will start taking helps from volunteers
- But before assigning them tasks we will take a personal interview of them to get a decent idea of
  there personal nature, so as to remove any hassle in future.

### Marketing

- We will market ourselves:
    - as an E-commerce site on major social platforms
    - as a Free Distributing Organisation on small pamphlets at all the needy places.

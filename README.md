## IDEA

We are planning to make a website portal for a Blood Bank which can organise all there interaction
with donor or requester.

### Features

1. Simple Log-in / Sign-up process, same for all.
2. Members can apply for donate or can request for blood or other organs.
3. Things which can be donated:
    - while alive:
        - blood
        - bone marrow
        - kidney
        - lung
        - liver
        - pancreas
        - intestine
    - after death
        - whole body (highly appreciated)
        - eyes
4. We will be making the following action buttons:
    1. **Donate Now**: members can donate right now
    2. **Request**: members can request other members 
5. Donation will be held in two process
    1. **Donate Now**: donor will be appointed a hospital where he/she can go and donate at the
       appointed time.
    2. **As per Request**: whenever someone requests we will shortlist the members and give the list
       of the shortlisted members to the requester and a notification to all the shortlisted members
       for the request.
6. We will be making a list of hospitals (for now, only state-wide coverage; but will expand in
   future) so that we can appoint donations to there nearest hospitals.
7. Due to COVID-19, we will make an appointment system, which will have the following features:
    - We will only appoint one donor for a single time-slot (one time-slot will be of 30 minutes).
    - After every donation the hospitals will have ample amount of time so that they can sanitize.
    - The normal guideline given by the government will be followed:
        - every persons temperature will be monitored before entering the premises
        - they should sanitize there hands at the gate
        - they should wear mask at all time
